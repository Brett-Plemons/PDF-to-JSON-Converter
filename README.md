# Using Python to take information from .pdf and .txt and input into a database/ create .json

**Semester:** Spring 2019

**Project Area:** Molecular Biology

## Objective
Write a python script that will take a .pdf, or .txt file from the user to retrieve primer information (GC%, TM temperature, Dilution volume, molecular weight, primer sequence, number of basepairs, who ordered, and date) and organize it into .json files, or input into an existing database. 

## Outcomes
This script should create a hassle-less way to extract and input data in a way that is easy to access.

## Rationale
The most tedious part of upkeeping a database and inventory is data input. Whether that be a collection of .json files or a structured database like those maintained with SQL. Python, however, can be used as a tool to reduce the tedium of data entry by automating this process.

My lab, like many other labs, is constantly receiving new primers specific to each project, as well as sequence data, and other chemicals for molecular experiments. My goal is to provide a hassle-less method of taking data sent to our lab by IDT, Sigma, GeneWiz, and created by our labmates and inputting it into a SQL Database.

This will also give my lab the ability to inventory, and check inventory for products, as well as check primers for projects to avoid replicates.

# Calculating TM and dilution volume for primers

**Name:** Brett Plemons 
<br/>
**Semester:** Spring 2019
<br/>
**Project Area:** Molecular Biology

## Objective
Write a python script that can reference, input, and retrieve data from an SQL database.

## Outcomes
This script should provide an organized way to access, and input data into an SQL database.

## Rationale
The most tedious part of upkeeping a database and inventory is data input. On its own SQL is not capable of taking data from invoices or sequence data and organizing it. It is simply a structure in which needs a high level language like python to receive data and input it into the database.

My lab, like many other labs, is constantly receiving new primers specific to each project, as well as sequence data, and other chemicals for molecular experiments. My goal is to provide a hassle-less method of taking data sent to our lab by IDT, Sigma, GeneWiz, and created by our labmates and inputting it into a SQL Database.
